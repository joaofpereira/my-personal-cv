Currently, I'm working at Semasio/Fyllo as a Senior Backend Developer. My main focus is on implementing and enhancing performance on .NET micro-services that compose the company's product.

During my period on Semasio I have also enhanced my knowledge on system architecture, distributed systems, low-level programming and DevOps.

I'm a former student of Informatics and Computing Engineering on FEUP (Faculdade Engenharia da Universidade do Porto), where I was invited to be Teacher Assistant during two consecutive years on the Computer Graphics course.
During my thesis, I made some research work to LIACC (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Laboratory) on FEUP.

Good to mention that my main technological stack is, at the moment, C\#.

As off-work interests, I spent a lot of time watching sports, cooking, travel, and studying new technologies.
